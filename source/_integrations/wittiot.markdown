## WittIOT configuration

The following steps must be performed to set up this integration.

1. Configure WittBoy to your LAN using the ws view plus or ecowitt app on your phone and then view the device IP address.
2. Enter the IP address of the device into the integration, and the integration will obtain WittBoy's data after a successful connection.

Home Assistant and WittBoy need to be in the same LAN for WittIOT integration to properly capture data.
